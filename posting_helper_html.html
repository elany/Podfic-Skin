<!-- Hi! Elany here, welcome to uh my pdfic skin tour I suppose. This HTML is Podfic Posting Helper ready! The only things you have to replace are your name - you only need to do that once - and details like fle size and length. Those you'll unfortunately have to do manually. -->

<div class="podfic">
    <img src="IMG" /> <!-- This is where your cover art link goes. Mind that this skin DOES NOT work without cover art! You could replace it with an empty circle, but currently the skin isn't built like that. -->

<div class="description">
Reader:<a href="YOU" rel="nofollow"> YOUR_NAME</a><br /> <!-- Link to your profile and your name. If you're using the helper you only need to change this once. -->
Author: ${authors} | Text: ${title}<br />
Music: <a href="MUSIC" rel="nofollow">MUSIC_NAME</a><br /> <!-- Link to music or sfx you're using and credits -->
${summary} <!-- Here's where you get to include the summary but if it's too long it'll break the skin -->
</div>

<!-- replace all instances of AUDIO with the link to your pod and ofc change things like the length, file type and size =D -->
