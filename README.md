<h2>Hi! Elany here and this is the code for my podfic skin.</h2>

There are two branches in this repo:
- main branch, with the off-site code. <a href="https://elany.github.io/into-dust-together/">You can find an example of what the skin looks off-site here.</a>
- AO3 branch, with AO3 ready code. In that one you'll find the CSS and two versions of HTML - one that can be used by anybody and another that's mean to be used with <a href="https://lazycats.dev">Podfic Posting Helper</a> and offers a measure of automation.

Feel free to use this skin for your own work, play around with it, style it however you want, break it and (not) put it back together or clean up the code and send me back an improved version haha

Ta-ta!
